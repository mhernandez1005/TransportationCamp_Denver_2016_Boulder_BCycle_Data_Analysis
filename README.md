# Welcome

BCycle Data Analysis results by Longmont Data Science.
Below are some questions we hope to answer.

  - Are more bcycles being checked out?
  - Is the number of users going up?
  - Can we quantify the average time riders are using the bikes?
  - Can we quantify the total time riders are using the bikes?

Filtering and Grouping:
  
  - Included only Boulder Based riders.
  - Group data by rider_id
  - Created a Primary key between rider_id and checkout_location

Initial draft findings
